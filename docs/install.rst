Installation
============

Dynamo Consistency requires the `XRootD <http://xrootd.org/doc/python/xrootd-python-0.1.0/>`_ Python module to be installed separately.
In addition, it uses the Dynamo Dynamic Data Management package to get inventory listings
and to report results of the consistency check.
Any other needed packages are installed with Dynamo Consistency during installation.

The simplest way to install is through pip::

  pip install dynamo-consistency

The source code is maintained on `GitHub <https://github.com/SmartDataProjects/dynamo-consistency>`_.
Other typical ``setuptools`` methods are supported by the repository's ``setup.py``.
