# The configuration file for ConsistencyChecks is a YAML file.
# It's keys are the following:
#
# - **CacheLocation** - The directory where all cached information is stored
# - **InventoryAge** - The age, in days of how old the information from the inventory can be
# - **ListAge** - The age, in days, of how old the list of files directly from the site can be
# - **RedirectorAge** - The age, in days, of how old the information about redirectors can be
# - **Redirectors** - A dictionary with keys of sites with hard-coded redirector locations.
#   If a site is not listed in this way, the redirector is found by matching domains from
#   :py:func:`CMSToolBox.siteinfo.get_domain` to redirectors found in a generic ``xrdfs locate`` call.
# - **SiteList** - An optional list, which tells the ConsistencyCheck which sites to run over.
#   All known T1s, T2s, or T3s can be run on by including ``'T1s'``, ``'T2s'``, or ``'T3s'``, respectively.
# - **WebPageLocation** - The place to copy webpages containing results to.
#
# Any file older than its set age must be regenerated
