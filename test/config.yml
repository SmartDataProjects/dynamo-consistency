##!
#
# - **DirectoryList** - A list of directories inside of ``/store/`` to check consistency.
# - **IgnoreDirectories** - The check ignores any paths that contain any of the strings in this list.
# - **PathPrefix** - A dictionary of prefixes to place before ``/store/`` in the XRootD call.
#   If the prefix is not set for a site, and it fails to list ``/store``, it tries ``/cms/store``
#   (prefix ``'/cms'``) by default.
# - **MaxMissing** - If more files than this number are missing,
#   then there will be no automatic entry into the register
# - **MaxOrphan** - If more than files than this number are orphan files at a site,
#   then there will be no automatic entry into the register
# - **CacheLocation** - The directory where all cached information is stored
# - **SaveCache** - If set and evaluates to True, copies old cached directory trees instead of overwriting
# - **IgnoreAge** - Ignore any files or directories with an age less than this, in days.
# - **LogLocation** - The directory where all the logs are stored
# - **WebDir** - The directory where text files and the sqlite3 database live
# - **InventoryAge** - The age, in days, of how old the information from the inventory can be
# - **ListAge** - The age, in days, of how old the list of files directly from the site can be
# - **GlobalRedirectors** - The redirectors to start all locate calls from, unless looking
#   for a site that is listed in the **Redirectors** configuration.
# - **Redirectors** - A dictionary with keys of sites with hard-coded redirector locations.
#   If a site is not listed in this way, the redirector is found by matching domains from
#   :py:func:`CMSToolBox.siteinfo.get_domain` to redirectors found in a generic ``xrdfs locate`` call.
# - **UseLoadBalancer** - A list of sites where the main redirector of the site is used
# - **RedirectorAge** - The age, in days, of how old the information on doors from redirectors can be.
#   If this value is set to zero, the redirector information is never refreshed.
# - **BothList** - Sites in this list will use the listing from their primary and backup doors.
#   This is used because sites like T1_US_FNAL use two ports on the same host to list different files.
# - **Timeout** - This gives the amount of time, in seconds, that you want the listing to try to run
#   on a single directory before it times out.
# - **Retries** - Number of retries after timeouts to attempt
# - **NumThreads** - This variable overwrites the values of MaxThreads and
#   MinThreads to be the same, if its value is non-zero.
# - **MaxThreads** - The maximum number of threads to run the check with.
#   If 0, the application can use as many threads as processors.
# - **MinThreads** - The minimum number of threads. This will cause multiple connections
#   to the same doors if the number of threads would be smaller otherwise.
#   The program tries to spread connections evenly over available doors.
#   If MinThreads is larger than MaxThreads, MaxThreads takes precedence.
#   The two are useful separately if you want to operate in a window, but this parameter can be used
#   to quickly fix the number of threads for a given run.
