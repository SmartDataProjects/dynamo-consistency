##!
#
# - **AccessMethod** - A dictionary of access methods for sites. Sites default to XRootD,
#   but setting a value of ``SRM`` causes the site to be listed by ``gfal-ls`` commands.
# - **DirectoryList** - A list of directories inside of **RootPath** to check consistency.
# - **DeleteOrphans** - By default, is true.
#   If set to false, orphan files will all be filtered out so that none are deleted.
# - **FreeMem** - The amount of free memory that is required before ``dynamo-consistency``
#   tries to run a check. The memory is given in GBs.
# - **GFALThreads** - The number of threads used by the GFAL listers
# - **GlobalRedirectors** - The redirectors to start all locate calls from, unless looking
#   for a site that is listed in the **Redirectors** configuration.
# - **IgnoreAge** - Ignore any files or directories with an age less than this, in days.
# - **IgnoreDirectories** - The check ignores any paths that contain any of the strings in this list.
# - **InventoryAge** - The age, in days, of how old the information from the inventory can be
# - **ListAge** - The age, in days, of how old the list of files directly from the site can be
# - **ListDeletable** - Configuration for unmerged cleaning "listdeletable" module.
#   Details on some of the configuration parameters are
#   `here <https://cms-comp-ops-tools.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7/siteadmintoolkit.html#configuration>`_.
# - **MaxMissing** - If more files than this number are missing,
#   then there will be no automatic entry into the register.
# - **MaxOrphan** - If more than files than this number are orphan files at a site,
#   then there will be no automatic entry into the register.
# - **NumThreads** - The number of threads used by the XRootD listers
# - **PathPrefix** - A dictionary of prefixes to place before **RootPath** in the XRootD call.
#   If the prefix is not set for a site, and it fails to list **RootPath**, it uses the default ``/cms``.
# - **RedirectorAge** - The age, in days, of how old the information on doors from redirectors can be.
#   If this value is set to zero, the redirector information is never refreshed.
# - **Redirectors** - A dictionary with keys of sites with hard-coded redirector locations.
#   If a site is not listed in this way, the redirector is found by matching domains from
#   :py:func:`CMSToolBox.siteinfo.get_domain` to redirectors found in a generic ``xrdfs locate`` call.
# - **Retries** - Number of retries after timeouts to attempt
# - **RootPath** - The directory where all of the listed subdirectories will be under.
#   For CMS sites, this will be ``"/store"``
# - **SaveCache** - If set and evaluates to True, copies old cached directory trees instead of overwriting
# - **Timeout** - This gives the amount of time, in seconds, that you want the listing to try to run
#   on a single directory before it times out.
# - **Unmerged** - A list of sites to handle cleaning of ``/store/unmerged`` on.
#   If the list is empty, all the sites are managed centrally
# - **UnmergedLogsAge** - The minimum age of the unmerged logs to be deleted, in days
# - **UseLoadBalancer** - A list of sites where the main redirector of the site is used
# - **VarLocation** - The location for the varying directory.
#   Inside this directory will be::
#
#     - Logs
#     - Redirector lists
#     - Cached trees
#     - Lock files
#
# - **WebDir** - The directory where text files and the sqlite3 database live
